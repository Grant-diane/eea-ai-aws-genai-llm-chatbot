# Model Requirements

## Amazon Bedrock requirements

**Base Models Access**

If you are looking to interact with models from Amazon Bedrock, you need to [request access to the base models in one of the regions where Amazon Bedrock is available](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?#/modelaccess). Make sure to read and accept models' end-user license agreements or EULA.

Note:

- You can deploy the solution to a different region from where you requested Base Model access.
- **While the Base Model access approval is instant, it might take several minutes to get access and see the list of models in the UI.**
